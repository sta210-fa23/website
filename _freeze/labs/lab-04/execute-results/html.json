You will also start working with your lab teams, write a team agreement, and be introduced to using GitHub for collaboration.\n\n# Learning goals\n\nBy the end of the lab you will be able to...\n\n-   assess model conditions for simple linear regression.\n-   calculate and interpret predicted values from the model.\n-   assess model fit using $R^2$ and RMSE\n-   collaborate with others using a single Github repo\n\n# Meet your team!\n\n[**Click here**](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/mt324_duke_edu/EYSH_1f6JnxClPeTx0PA6HgBLJLDwULnKRFboL_WTSv4dw?e=T5lze5) to see the team assignments for STA 210. This will be your team for labs and the final project. Before you get started on the lab, complete the following:\n\n‚úÖ Come up with a team name. You can't use the same name as another team, so I encourage you to be creative! Your TA will get your team name by the end of lab.\n\n‚úÖ Fill out the team agreement. This will help you figure out a plan for communication,and working together during labs and outside of lab times. You can find the team agreement in the GitHub repo **team-agreement-\\[github_team_name\\]**.\n\n-   Have **one person** from the team clone the repo and start a new RStudio project. This person will type the team's responses as you discuss the sections of the agreement. No one else in the team should type at this point but should be contributing to the discussion.\n\n-   Be sure to push the completed agreement to GitHub. Each team member can refer to the document in this repo or download the PDF of the agreement for future reference. *You do [not]{.underline} need to submit the agreement on Gradescope.*\n\n# Getting started\n\n-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n-   Go to the [sta210-fa23](https://github.com/sta210-fa23) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-04**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.\n-   **Do not make any changes to the `.qmd` file until the instructions tell you do to so.**\n\n# Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\n\n::: callout-important\nAssign each person on your team a number 1 through 4. For teams of three, Team Member 1 can take on the role of Team Member 4.\n\nThe following exercises must be done in order. **Only one person should type in the `.qmd` file, commit, and push updates at a time.** When it is not your turn to type, you should still share ideas and contribute to the team's discussion.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n‚å®Ô∏è **Team Member 1: Hands on the keyboard.**\n\nüôÖüèΩ All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed![^1]\n:::\n\n[^1]: Don't trust yourself to keep your hands off the keyboard? Put them in your pocket or cross your arms. No matter how silly it might feel, resist the urge to touch your keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\nChange the author to your team name and include each team member's name in the `author` field of the YAML in the following format: `Team Name: Member 1, Member 2, Member 3, Member 4`.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n**Team Member 1:** Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF. Then, commit (with an informative commit message) both the `.qmd` and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub.\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n::: pull\n**Team Members 2, 3, 4:** Once Team Member 1 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team's lab repo. Then, in RStudio, click the **Pull** button in the Git pane to get the updated document.

Type the team's response to exercise 3.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nBefore using the model for prediction, let's check the model conditions. To figure out how to do so, we type the following prompt into ChatGPT (\"an AI powered language model\") *\"How do you check the model conditions for simple linear regression?\"*\n\nThe response from ChatGPT shown below would receive partial credit. For each condition, state whether it is correct or incorrect/ incomplete. If it incorrect/incomplete, state what is wrong or missing, then write the correct response.\n\n> *In simple linear regression, you're trying to establish a linear relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X). The model conditions or assumptions for simple linear regression are important to check to ensure that your model is valid and reliable. Here are the key assumptions and how to check them:*\n>\n> *1. Linearity Assumption:*\n>\n> -   *Assumption: The relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is linear.*\n> -   *How to Check: Create a scatterplot of Y against X. If the points roughly form a straight line, the linearity assumption is likely met.*\n>\n> *2. Independence Assumption:*\n>\n> -   *Assumption: The residuals (the differences between observed Y and predicted Y) are independent of each other.*\n> -   *How to Check: Plot the residuals against the independent variable (X) or the predicted values. Look for patterns or trends in the residuals. There should be no clear structure or autocorrelation in the residuals.*\n>\n> *3. Homoscedasticity \\[Constant variance\\] Assumption:*\n>\n> -   *Assumption: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable.*\n> -   *How to Check: Plot the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variable (X). The spread of the residuals should remain roughly constant across the range of X.*\n>\n> *4. Normality Assumption:*\n>\n> -   *Assumption: The residuals follow a normal distribution.*\n> -   *How to Check: Create a histogram or a normal probability plot (Q-Q plot) of the residuals. If the residuals are approximately normally distributed, they should follow a bell-shaped curve in the histogram and lie along a straight line in the Q-Q plot.*\n>\n> *It's important to note that these assumptions may not always hold perfectly in real-world data, and minor violations may not necessarily invalidate your model. However, if you detect significant violations of these assumptions, you may need to consider alternative modeling techniques or transformations of your data to address the issues.*\n\n::: render-commit-push\n‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Team Member 2**: Render, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message again.
